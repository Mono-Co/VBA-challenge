Module 2 Challenge

This is my VBA Code for the Module 2.

Our Challenge was to;

Create a VBS script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information in a new table:
1. The ticker symbol
2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4. The total stock volume of the stock.
5. We have also added a colour coded formatting to the cell to show a positive or negative movement of the stock.
6. Finally, Added a BONUS functionality to return the stock with the have return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

The time taken to run the script was less than 40s. Please refer to the screenshot beloe
